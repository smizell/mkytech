# DRAFT: Murray Technology Council

The goal of this document is to begin a discussion on how we can create a technology council that exists for the betterment of Murray. This is a work in progress, and is meant to be a place to start discussing ideas.

## Purpose of this Group

The purpose of this group is to ultimately affect Murray for the better. This will be done specifically through fostering the growth of tech communities, aiding in the support of business development around tech, and working to help get tech in education.

## Areas of Focus

I see three primary areas of focus for this council:

1. Tech communities
2. Business Development
3. Education

### Tech Communities

This would include helping get awareness for existing groups and creating and organizing new groups. The group would try to help strengthen what is already here, but also work to find areas of technology where a community/meetup could exist. 

#### Ideas for Initiatives Around Tech Communities

1. Manage a city-wide calendar for all tech events
2. Create meetups around areas of tech
3. Organize conferences around tech
4. Create some type of mentoring program to pair experienced techs with aspiring techs

### Business Development

This would include starting conversations between existing business on how they could benefit from technology, along with helping to come up with ideas for how tech businesses could be started in Murray.

#### Ideas for Initiatives Around Business Development

1. Work with the Chamber to help educate business on tech
2. Create a monthly newsletter/magazine that focuses on tech use in Murray. This may focus on a particular business and have interviews. As this grows, you would have a directory of what certain types of businesses in Murray use for tech.
3. Look at starting co-work spaces, either through private companies or through an initiative by the city. Having a co-workspace on the square for entrepreneurs in general would be a great way to grow the square.
4. Organize small conferences around tech in business, which may include small workshops.
5. Create a job board for tech jobs around the Murray area, which would allow for free posting.

### Education

This would include working with local schools to help find direction for tech programs, helping start after-school programs for kids, and even helping to educate adults interested in technology. This would also include a partnership with Murray State technology departments to help them get kids interested in tech before coming to Murray, along with helping students there get involved in our tech communities and business development projects.

#### Ideas for Initiatives Around Education

1. Help people use technology for important things, like helping people sign up for Kynect to get insurance by opening up lab that is on public transportation route
2. Get involved with public education to help modernize tech programs, especially around programming since it may become a second language
2. Create after-school programs for kids to learn about tech
3. Work with housing authority to help teach kids/adults tech, from simply computer usage, to resume building, and even for creating interest for kids to pursue tech for fun and learning
4. Work with local STLPs to put students in contact with professionals

## Distinctives

I see a few distinctives for this group.

1. Independent
2. Open Community
2. Helping Marginalized and Underprivileged

### Independent

One aspect of this group will be to remain independent from other government, business, and academic entities. The idea here is that we exist for the betterment of our community and not for any particular entity. 

### Open Community

The reason for this is that this group exists for the betterment of the society. Everything we produce is given to the community, either released under a full-access license or by going directly to the public domain. Although everyone involved will benefit indirectly from this group, all direct benefits are contributed back to society.

### Helping Marginalized and Underprivileged

As a way to help our community as a whole, this group should seek to work with the marginalized and underprivileged in our area with the purpose of helping them get an opportunity to get involved in technology.

## Structure of Group

I'm not sure the best way to organize this, as many big-city councils have presidents, board of directors, board of advisors, etc. Being an open community, I would like for this to be as flat as possible, with a few core people helping to lead direction and approving initiatives. 

1. **Core Members** - These will be the people who direct the group in doing work within our focus.
2. **Business Advisors** - These are business men and women who are not necessarily in technology, but who value it and want to help create awareness.
3. **Sponsors** - These are businesses and individuals who sponsor events, conferences, or any other initiative that needs capital.
4. **Members** - These are general members who seek to work on tasks that this group has going. There are a lot of items listed in this document, and this will require a large group of people.

## Information on Open Companies

The only reason for including the idea of being open and these links for open companies is because I've been really interested in the idea, and I think it could work really well for a group like this. Plus, if our goal is to help our community, it's a really great fit.
